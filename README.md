# Hello, Human (or I.A) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" height="30px"/>

I am a graduated system analyst and currently studying front-end development searching for a collab opportunities, remote works or projects.

- 🎬 I'm little bit away of I.T area in the last years working as audiovisual producer.
- 🧐 I’m currently recaping HTML, CSS and JS to retake my studies in React and NodeJs. (I have some knowledge in Angular too).
- 🔍 Also i'm interested in learning Python and R in a near future. (But one step at a time, right?). 
- 🤝 Lastly, i'm open to pair programming projects with other newbies on front-end development. (Unity is strength!)
